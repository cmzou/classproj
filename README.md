# Classifying Court Documents by Violations

Mortgage enforcement actions can provide insight into the efficacy of policy, enforcement trends, and prevalence of law breaking. Traditional methods to extracting information from texts such as the specific violations of the law can be costly. We explore the efficacy of machine learning models such as support vector machines and neural networks to aid in classification. We find that these methods can give high accuracy, but other metrics such as precision reveal they lack the ability to effectively find true positives.

This repository hosts the code used to generate the results, the code for initial EDA, and the final report.
